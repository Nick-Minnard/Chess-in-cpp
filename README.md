# Chess-in-cpp

This is a program that has the ability to generate legal chess moves from any given posistion.
I pretty much learned cpp from scratch just so the program would run faster.
While it is the only major program I have written in cpp, it remains one of my most in depth projects.
Cpp support is all that is required to run the program.
When run some tests and demonstrations will be displayed but the main.cpp file can be adjusted accordingly.
